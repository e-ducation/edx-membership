# Third-party installed apps that we also extract strings from.  When adding a
# file here, also add it to the django.po merge files below, and to the
# .tx/config file so that it will be pushed to and pulled from transifex.
# third_party:
#     - wiki


# How should .po files be segmented?  See i18n/segment.py for details. Strings
# that are only found in a particular segment are segregated into that .po file
# so that translators can focus on separate parts of the product.
#
# We segregate Studio so we can provide new languages for LMS without having to
# also translate the Studio strings. LMS needs the strings from lms/* and
# common/*, so those will stay in the main .po file.    

# How should the generate step merge files?
